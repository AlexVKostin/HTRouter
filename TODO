[.] Fix module mod_rewrite
[ ] Add default fallback module for authentication (really needed?)
[ ] Trimming should be done by config parser, not the actual modules
[ ] refactor explode() into preg_split()  (why is that again?)
[ ] Correct path-info when dealing with apache router.php and uri: /router.php/test/blaat.php/this/is/pathinfo?debug
[ ] Remove subrequests. We don't use them (maybe dir.c uses it?)
[ ] Condition / _expandTestString needs to be fixed
[ ] When merging variables, we should have an additional parameter specifying on what to merge (from a method inside module?)
[ ] Remove subrequests. We don't use them
[ ] In directives, do we need \HTRouter\Request $request or does the variableContainer (getConfig()) suffice?)
