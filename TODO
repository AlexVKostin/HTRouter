[.] Add module mod_rewrite
[ ] Add default fallback module for auth
[X] Make sure _run does work properly instead of just running hooks
[X] Every hook should return constand (DENIED, OK, or HTTP_CODE etc). When HTTP_CODE, just do redirect,
[X] Also emulate a request_rec so things will function more smoothly and concise with apache
[ ] Trimming should be done by config parser, not the actual modules
[X] Need to order phases correctly: auth comes before fixup! http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/mod/mod_rewrite.html#rewritecond
[ ] Move logging and initialization into separate class

Maybe:
[ ] Have a generic htrouter.yml that can be parsed with all kind of info: generic flags, documentroot etc?

Check:
[ ] Should we pass the router or the request to modules? Looks like the only (correct) thing we do is $router->getRequest() anyway
